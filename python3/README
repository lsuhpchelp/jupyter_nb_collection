A collection of Jupyter Notebooks

Notes:

1. All notebooks were retrieved via links on the "A gallery of interesting Jupyter Notebooks" web page: https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks; 
2. All notebooks were tested with Python 3.6.4 (python/3.6.4-anaconda) on Super Mike 2;
3. After a missing module is installed using "pip install", the notebook kernel needs to be shut down and restarted before the new module can be successfully imported.
